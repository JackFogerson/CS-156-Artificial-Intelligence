"""
Main program to guide Sammy the Spartan on a quest within a given maze

Usage:  spartanquest.py maze_file search_algorithm
The maze_file is a text file such as SJSU.txt
The search_algorithm in homework 3 is:
    dfs: for depth first search
    bfs: for breadth first search
    ucs for uniform cost search
The search_algorithm in homework 4 is:
    astar: for A*  search

Example:  spartanquest.py SJSU.txt dfs

The uninformed search algorithms functions are implemented in the file
uninformed_search.py.

Your task for homework 4 is to implement astar in informed_search.py.
