"""
Main program to guide Sammy the Spartan on a quest within a given maze

Usage:  spartanquest.py maze_file search_algorithm
The maze_file is a text file such as SJSU.txt
The search_algorithm in homework 3 is:
    dfs: for depth first search
    bfs: for breadth first search
    ucs for uniform cost search
Example:  spartanquest.py SJSU.txt dfs

The uninformed search algorithms functions are implemented in the file
uninformed_search.py.

dfs has been implemented for you.
Your task for homework 3 is to implement bfs and ucs.
