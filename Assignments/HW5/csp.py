"""
Class definition for a Constraint Satisfaction Problem.

To create a CSP object, we need to specify the following:
domains: a dictionary representing variables and their domains.
        The dictionary keys are variable names and the values are sets
        representing their domains.
neighbors: a dictionary representing binary constraints.
        The dictionary keys are variable names and the values are sets
        containing all the variables that are connected to the key.
        (Variables are connected if they both appear in a constraint)
constraint: a function that takes as arguments two variables
        and two values: f(var1, val1, var2, val2).
        The function must return True if var1 and var2 satisfy the
        constraint when their respective values are val1 and val2.
